{{PROBLEM}} Multi-Class Planned Design Recipe
1. Describe the Problem
Put or write the user story here. Add any clarifying notes you might have.

2. Design the Class System
Consider diagramming out the classes and their relationships. Take care to focus on the details you see as important, not everything. The diagram below uses asciiflow.com but you could also use excalidraw.com, draw.io, or miro.com

┌────────────────────────────┐
│ MusicPlayer                │
│                            │

│ - add(track)               │
│ - search_by_title(keyword) │
│   => [tracks...]           │
└───────────┬────────────────┘

Also design the interface of each class in more detail.
